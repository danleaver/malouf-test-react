# Malouf Sleep Coding Test

This project was a coding test for a job. My task was to code a design from a figma mockup, and to add my own flair to the widgets and sliders. I had a week to complete it.


## Features

Early on I foucused on just getting the basic structure of the site up, and getting the styling as close as possible. I decided to put a little more energy into the Project Categories slider over other parts of the site because I thought it would stand out and demonstrate some Javascript skills. I also put on the Accessibility Widget to toggle keyboard navigation.

## Framework

I originally interpreted the instructions as prohibiting me from using a framework, and before clarifiying, I went about styling a lot of the website using a css stylesheet. Upon learning that I could use React, I started migrating everything over to @emotion/styled components. If I had more time, I would move the remaining css (along with the @emotion/css in-line styling) into styled components.

## Installation

This is just your standard Create-React-App. Yarn start in the project directory will run a development environment.
